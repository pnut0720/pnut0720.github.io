        <h1>The Easiest Way to Grip the Club</h1>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
          The grip could arguably be the most critical aspect of a golf swing. Consider it as the “steering wheel” of your swing. 
          The right grip has the power to dictate the path and direction of the clubhead, influencing the trajectory and eventual flight of the ball.
          Modern golf grips have alignment marks that guide your hands into the correct position, making it easier for amateurs to get a hold the grip correctly.
          There are many grips to choose from. Here’s a simple method to improve your grip: Begin with a visual check: The back of your left hand and the palm of your right hand (for right-handed golfers) should face the target. 
          Slide your hands down on the grip until the club is lying across the fingertips of your left hand. Wrap your fingers around the handle, keeping the ‘squishy’ part of your thumb straight on top of the grip. 
          Ensure the first two knuckles of your hand are visible, and the crease between your thumb and index finger should point towards your trail shoulder (right shoulder for right handed golfers).
